<b>Terms of services</b></br>
In this page you'll learn that you own and control what you share and we want your experience to be perfect. We do ask that you treat our service and community with respect. If you ever stumble across anything that looks like it violates this simple rule, please let us know.
The OPCAM services are operated and managed by Team AMSA (hereinafter referred to as “AMSA”), a Korean company.
</p>
<b>Access to the service</b></br>
Access to OPCAM is only permitted subject to acceptance of these general terms and conditions of use, which OPCAM shall, however, be free to modify at any time. Any notification may be sent to the user by e-mail. Additional rules and lines of conduct shall be deemed to form an integral part of these general terms and conditions.
The user is therefore advised regularly to refer to the latest version of these terms and conditions, which are available at all times on this page. In the framework of the use made of the service, the user shall expressly refrain from:
Publishing any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening or improper, that constitutes harassment, that is defamatory, vulgar or obscene, that threatens another person’s privacy, or that is hateful, racist or in any other way reprehensible;
Publishing any content that contravenes the national and international laws in force;
Publishing any content that infringes any patent, registered trademark, manufacturing secret, intellectual property right or any other right of property belonging to other people;
Collecting and storing personal data relating to the other users.
</p>
<b>Services content</b></br>
OPCAM guarantees that the elements, services and functions placed at the user’s disposal comply substantially with the generally accepted standards if they are used in accordance with the instructions provided, and that the programs and all elements created by OPCAM and made available to the user respect third parties’ rights and in general are not unlawful.
OPCAM is bound, in a general fashion, by an obligation to use all reasonable means to accomplish a desired result, without guaranteeing said result.
OPCAM shall under no circumstances be held liable for any direct and/or indirect loss or damage sustained by the user in the context of use of the website and/or the content thereof placed at his/her disposal. Likewise, OPCAM shall only be liable for fraudulent misrepresentation or gross negligence attributable to it. It shall not be liable for fraudulent misrepresentation or gross negligence on the part of its agents, principals and as a general rule its implementing officers.
The user shall also hold AMSA harmless in the event of any claim, in one or other of the following cases:
Loss of opportunities or of business income linked to the functioning or non-functioning or use or non-use of the services, or of the content that is on it or should be on it;
Illegal or unauthorized intrusion of any third party in the OPCAM servers;
Temporary congestion of the bandwidth;
Break in the internet connection service for reasons beyond the control of OPCAM.
The user accepts that the functions offered on the services are subject to change. This means that some functions may be removed and others added, without the user being able to regard access to a particular function as an acquired right. Likewise, OPCAM alone shall decide on the expediency of inclusion or removal of a particular content presented on the website.
</p>
<b>Your rights</b></br>
The user shall own all user content that user contributes to the services, but hereby grants and agrees to grant OPCAM a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute and store such user content (“Content license”) in order to provide and promote the services.
</p>
<b>Warranty disclaimer</b></br>
OPCAM reserves the right, at any time and on any grounds whatsoever, to alter or temporarily or permanently discontinue all or part of the access to the website, without having to inform the user thereof beforehand. This will be the case, for example, in the event of website maintenance or a major change in the services and/or functions offered. OPCAM may not be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage associated with an alteration or suspension of or interruption in access to the website, for any reason whatsoever.
</p>
<b>Copyright policy</b></br>
The information, logos, drawings, brand names, models, slogans, graphic charts, etc. accessible through the website may be protected by intellectual and/or industrial property rights. Except where expressly authorized to this end by OPCAM and/or the third party concerned, the user shall not be allowed to modify, reproduce, rent out, borrow, sell, distribute or create derived works based entirely or partially on the elements contained on the website. It is therefore not allowed (and may not authorize other people) to copy, modify or create a derived work, reverse the design or assembly or attempt in any other way to find the source code, sell, grant, sublicense or transfer in any way whatsoever, any right relating to the website and its content.
